# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python. It was created as the first project during my journey to learn Python programming. This game is designed to provide a basic introduction to Python syntax and control structures.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone [<repository-url>](https://github.com/swapnil-siingh/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Python)
   ```

2. **Run the Game:** Navigate to the project directory and run the game by executing the Python script:
   ```
   python rock_paper_scissors.py
   ```

3. **Game Rules:**
   - You will be prompted to enter your choice: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
   - The computer will randomly select its choice.
   - The game will determine the winner based on the classic rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.
   - The result will be displayed on the screen, indicating whether you win, lose, or tie.

## Project Structure

- `rock_paper_scissors.py`: The main Python script that contains the game logic and user interactions.

## Future Improvements

This project is a basic implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors. As you continue your Python learning journey, you can explore enhancements such as:

- Adding a scoring system to track wins and losses.
- Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more engaging user experience.
- Implementing additional game variations, such as Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.
